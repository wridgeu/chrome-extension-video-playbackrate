# Chrome Browser Extension - Video Playback Rate

This extension is primarily for _chrome_ and (so far) mostly based on the getting started tutorial from [Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/).

## Why?

Why does this repository/extension exist? Well ... quite simple:

- I wanted to check out how a browser extension is made (a bit more hands-on)
- Wanted to explore some new things
- Even though there are already extensions out there to increase the speed of a video, I wanted my own ðŸ¤ª

Due to limited time and some irl wrist issues I'm just getting started with this and build it in public in order to hold myself accountable and actually pull through. ðŸª…

## ToDo

- [ ] Actually implement the core/base functionality.
- [ ] How is an extension being deployed?
- [x] How is a third party library being added (npm)?
  - Kind of answered this myself, although not really using a third party library but WebComponents instead
- [ ] What else could I do with it?
  - [ ] Add button for .X speed adjustments
  - [ ] Rework UI & use ShadowParts (Shadow DOM CSS)
  - [ ] Add list of Video-Elements on popup-page so the user can manually switch in case of multiple `video`-tags
  - [ ] Add proper error-handling
  - [ ] Rework sync. storage usage of chrome
  - [ ] Make extension cross-browser compatible
  - [ ] Learn more about .d.ts files and how to properly declare & add them into the project
  - [ ] Make extension [themable](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/playground/advanced/configuration/#theme) (include in options)
  - [ ] Make extension "save" your latest setting & automatically apply them on new pages (include in options)
  - [x] Make UI respect your latest change within the tab (if you selected 2 and reopen the extension it should also reflect speedValue 2)
  - [x] Configure [prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html)
  - [x] Add and configure ESLint
- [x] Rethink the folder structure.
- [x] Configure [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) for building the project
  - TS => JS => bundle/build/merge JS + Public folder => Dist
