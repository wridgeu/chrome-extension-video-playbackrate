# Chrome Browser Extension - Video Playback Rate

This extension is primarily for _chrome_ and (so far) mostly based on the getting started tutorial from [Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/).

## Why does this repository exist?

Well ... quite simple:

- I wanted to check out how a browser extension is made (a bit more hands-on)
- Wanted to explore some new things (e.g. Typescript, Rollup, Prettier, Linting, Workflows, GH-Hooks and so on...)
- Even though there are already extensions out there to increase the speed of a video, I wanted my own ðŸ¤ª

I'm just getting started with this and build it in public in order to hold myself accountable and actually pull through. ðŸª… Progress will be slow due to lots of other thing going on in my life.

## ToDo

- [X] Actually implement the core/base functionality (KISS)
- [X] How is an extension being deployed?
- [x] How is a third party library being added (npm)?
  - Kind of answered this myself, although not really using a third party library but WebComponents instead

What else could I do with it?
  - [x] Rework UI & use ShadowParts (Shadow DOM CSS)
  - [x] Add proper error-handling
  - [ ] Make extension cross-browser compatible(?)
  - [ ] Make extension [themable](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/playground/advanced/configuration/#theme) (include in options)
  - [X] Learn more about .d.ts files and how to declare & add them into the project
  - [x] Make UI respect your latest change within the tab (if you selected 2 and reopen the extension it should also reflect speedValue 2)
  - [x] Configure [prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html)
  - [x] Add and configure ESLint
  - [x] Rethink the folder structure
  - [x] Configure [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) for building the project
    - TS => JS => bundle/build/merge JS + Public folder => Dist

## Architectural _Overview_ of an Extension

The full and official introduction (from Chrome) can be found [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/architecture-overview/).

_Note:_ With Manifest V3 the "background page" is now using a [Service Worker](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/service_workers/).

### Content scripts

More details on content scripts can be found [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/content_scripts/).

![](./docs/img/content-scripts_1.png)

Communication between the content script and the parent extension is done either by using the [storage API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/) or using [messages](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/messaging/).
