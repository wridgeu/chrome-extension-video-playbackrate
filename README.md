# Chrome Browser Extension - Video Playback Rate

This extension is primarily for _chrome_ and (so far) mostly based on the getting started tutorial from [Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/).

## Why?

Why does this repository/extension exist? Well ... quite simple:

- I wanted to check out how a browser extension is made (a bit more hands-on)
- Wanted to explore some new things
- Even though there are already extensions out there to increase the speed of a video, I wanted my own ðŸ¤ª

Due to limited time and some irl wrist issues I'm just getting started with this and build it in public in order to hold myself accountable and actually pull through. ðŸª…

## ToDo

- [ ] Actually implement the core/base functionality.
- [ ] How is an extension being deployed?
- [ ] How is a third party library being added (npm)?
- [ ] What else could I do with it?
- [ ] Rethink the folder structure.
- [ ] Build it in typescript.
